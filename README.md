Teapots
-------

This repository collects implementations in various languages and 
styles of algorithms to decompose a triangle into right triangles.

Implementations are expected to parse the provided `teapot.txt` file
and render it on the screen (either in the browser or in graphics)
using only right triangles.

The implementations are actually homework assignments at TU Delft's
Functional Programming course, taught by Erik Meijer.
