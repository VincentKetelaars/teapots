Teapots
=======

This repository collects implementations in various languages and 
styles of algorithms to decompose a triangle into right triangles.

Implementations are expected to parse the provided `teapot.txt` file
and render it on the screen (either in the browser or in graphics)
using only right triangles.

The implementations are actually homework assignments at TU Delft's
[Functional Programming](http://swerl.tudelft.nl/bin/view/Main/FunctionalProgrammingCourse) course, taught by Erik Meijer.

Reference Rendering
-------------------

The provided file renders as follows. The purpose of the project is to 
remain visualy close to this rendering, using only right triangles.
